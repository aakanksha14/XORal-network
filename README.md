# XORal-network
This is the most basic form of neural network used for understanding the backpropagation algorithm using the XOR gate.

Language used: Python<br>
Library used: NumPy<br>

"keras_XOR.py" contains the implementation of the XOR gate using the keras library. It is a comparitively easier implementation than writing it using just the NumPy library.
